0,Bell pepper : Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial leaf spot is a common bacterial plant infection seen all around the world. It is most common in rainy, humid, and temperate climates. These are the environmental conditions in which the bacteria can spread most easily. Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Symptoms of this disease include fruit spots, leaf spots, and twig cankers. Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit. Early defoliated trees are reduced in vigor and winter hardiness.","1. Select resistant varieties
2. Purchase disease-free seed and transplants.
3. Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting.
4. Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings.
5. Avoid overhead watering.
6. Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season.
7. Spray every 10-14 days with fixed copper (organic fungicide) to slow down the spread of infection.
8. Rotate peppers to a different location if infections are severe and cover the soil with black plastic mulch or black landscape fabric prior to planting.",https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/grow_it_eat_it/diseases/BacterialLeafSpot/bacterial_leaf_spot_pepper_plant_l.jpg,https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/apple-scab-1.jpg,
1,Bell pepper : Healthy,"Keep bell peppers well-watered, but never leave soil soggy. Water to moisten soil about 6 inches deep, then let it dry slightly. Watering is especially important during fruit set, when tiny peppers take the place of blossoms, and as the bells mature. Consistent moisture helps keep peppers firm and healthy.","Red, Orange, and Yellow Bell Peppers are full of great health benefits—they're packed with vitamins and low in calories! They are an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium. Bell Peppers also contain a healthy dose of fiber, folate, and iron.",http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg,http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg,http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg
2,Bell pepper : Curling Leaves,"Here is a problem faced by first-time and veteran pepper growers alike. With so many possible causes, treating curled pepper leaves can be tricky.

Most of the time, curling pepper leaves is a sign of either too much light, too much water, or plant edema. There are diseases that can cause curled leaves, but if the plant appears otherwise healthy,","Choose resistant cultivars when available.
Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.
Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/apple-rust.jpg,,
3,Bell pepper : Mosaic Virus,"Another very common pepper plant issue is mosaic virus. There are many different types of mosaic virus, and once a plant is infected, it is irreversible. Some pepper varieties are resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, while none are resistant to cucumber mosaic virus.

Mosaic viruses can be seed borne or soil borne and are spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. They can also be spread by contact of infected plants, and are most problematic in dry weather.","Irrigate deeply, but infrequently.
Avoid using post-emergent weed killers on the lawn while the disease is active.
Avoid medium to high nitrogen fertilizer levels.
Improve air circulation and light level on lawn.
Mow at the proper height and only mow when the grass is dry.",https://previews.123rf.com/images/msnobody/msnobody1508/msnobody150800002/43698436-red-apple-on-a-branch-of-an-apple-tree-on-a-sunny-day-organic-farmingagriculture-fresh-healthy-natur.jpg,,
4,Bell pepper : Yellowing Leaves,"One of the most common issues pepper growers face is the dreaded yellowing leaves. While it is usually not a big deal, there are measures you need to take to correct this pepper plant problem.
Yellow Pepper Plant Leaves","1. Provide nitrogen : Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for healthy plant development. It helps pepper plants grow lots of big, strong green leaves. Provide magnesium & calcium. A magnesium deficiency will cause chlorosis when severe, meaning the veins of leaves will remain green while the rest turns yellow.  2. Provide magnesium & calcium. A magnesium deficiency will cause chlorosis when severe, meaning the veins of leaves will remain green while the rest turns yellow. 3. Don’t over-water. Over-watering is another possible reason for pepper plants turning yellow. Be sure to only provide water when necessary and to allow potted plants to drain excess water.
