0,Bell pepper : Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial leaf spot is a common bacterial plant infection seen all around the world. It is most common in rainy, humid, and temperate climates. These are the environmental conditions in which the bacteria can spread most easily. Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Symptoms of this disease include fruit spots, leaf spots, and twig cankers. Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit. Early defoliated trees are reduced in vigor and winter hardiness.","Select resistant varieties.
Purchase disease-free seed and transplants.
Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). 
Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting.
Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings.
Avoid overhead watering.
Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season.
Spray every 10-14 days with fixed copper (organic fungicide) to slow down the spread of infection.
Rotate peppers to a different location if infections are severe and cover the soil with black plastic mulch or black landscape fabric prior to planting.",https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/grow_it_eat_it/diseases/BacterialLeafSpot/bacterial_leaf_spot_pepper_plant_l.jpg,https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/apple-scab-1.jpg,
1,Bell pepper : Healthy,"Keep bell peppers well-watered, but never leave soil soggy. Water to moisten soil about 6 inches deep, then let it dry slightly. Watering is especially important during fruit set, when tiny peppers take the place of blossoms, and as the bells mature. Consistent moisture helps keep peppers firm and healthy.","Red, Orange, and Yellow Bell Peppers are full of great health benefits—they're packed with vitamins and low in calories! They are an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium. Bell Peppers also contain a healthy dose of fiber, folate, and iron.
Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.
Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.
Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base.
Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.
Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.
Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.",http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg,http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg,http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg
2,Bell pepper : Curling Leaves,"Here is a problem faced by first-time and veteran pepper growers alike. With so many possible causes, treating curled pepper leaves can be tricky.

Most of the time, curling pepper leaves is a sign of either too much light, too much water, or plant edema. There are diseases that can cause curled leaves, but if the plant appears otherwise healthy,","Choose resistant cultivars when available.
Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.
Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/apple-rust.jpg,,
3,Bell pepper : Mosaic Virus,"Another very common pepper plant issue is mosaic virus. There are many different types of mosaic virus, and once a plant is infected, it is irreversible. Some pepper varieties are resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, while none are resistant to cucumber mosaic virus.

Mosaic viruses can be seed borne or soil borne and are spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. They can also be spread by contact of infected plants, and are most problematic in dry weather.","Irrigate deeply, but infrequently.
Avoid using post-emergent weed killers on the lawn while the disease is active.
Avoid medium to high nitrogen fertilizer levels.
Improve air circulation and light level on lawn.
Mow at the proper height and only mow when the grass is dry.",https://previews.123rf.com/images/msnobody/msnobody1508/msnobody150800002/43698436-red-apple-on-a-branch-of-an-apple-tree-on-a-sunny-day-organic-farmingagriculture-fresh-healthy-natur.jpg,,
4,Bell pepper : Yellowing Leaves,"One of the most common issues pepper growers face is the dreaded yellowing leaves. While it is usually not a big deal, there are measures you need to take to correct this pepper plant problem.
                Many home gardeners enjoy growing peppers. Whether you grow bell peppers, other sweet peppers or chili peppers, growing your own pepper plants can be not only enjoyable but cost effective as well. But when pepper plant leaves turn yellow, it can leave gardeners scratching their heads. There are many things that can lead to pepper leaves turning yellow.    
               One of the two most common reasons for yellow leaves on a pepper plant is either under watering or a lack of nutrients in the soil. In both of these cases, pepper plants will also be stunted and will commonly drop the pepper flowers or fruit.                                                                                                                                                                   ","Provide nitrogen : Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for healthy plant development. It helps pepper plants grow lots of big, strong green leaves. Provide magnesium & calcium. A magnesium deficiency will cause chlorosis when severe, meaning the veins of leaves will remain green while the rest turns yellow.  
Provide magnesium & calcium. A magnesium deficiency will cause chlorosis when severe, meaning the veins of leaves will remain green while the rest turns yellow. 
Don’t over-water. Over-watering is another possible reason for pepper plants turning yellow. Be sure to only provide water when necessary and to allow potted plants to drain excess water. 
Find them a sunny spot because they love and need lots of light. I prefer a spot where they receive the morning sun.
If you have them in pots and/or other containers, it is good to move them during the day to take advantage of changing sunlight.
They are thirsty plants. Water them daily, especially if they are producing fruit. It is best to do it in the morning and to avoid wetting the leaves for disease prevention.
Keep them guarded from extreme weather conditions and wind. Please note that even if they like sunlight, being exposed to direct midday sunlight can be damaging as well.
You need to fertilize them because they need a lot of energy to produce strawberries. Buy a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10, 12-12-12, etc). Follow the directions because too much fertilizer can reduce the fruit yield and it may also stimulate runner production.",https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/blueberry-leaf-collection-isolated-on-260nw-308491814.jpg,,
